# Die

2019-09-12

Die is a shooter-platforming game that was developed using the pygame module in Python. The game was created in 2018 in collaboration with @zsaintd and was just recently added as a repository to my github.

I plan to do more work on this project in the future as well as explaining more about the game here, but for now this project is on hold.
